## Theoretical basis
- A signal is a physical qunatity that carries information or data that can travel far and separate information
- A sine signal is a type of analog signal signal that continously changes over time and has a sine modulated oscillation
- Mathemattical equations:
u(t) = A * sin(2πft + θ)
